# Function Expression :-
- There are 2 types in which we can declare a function in JS.
- A function can either be a `function definition` or a `function expression`.
- If the first word in our piece of code is not starting with the keyword "function" and it involves a function then it is a function expression.
eg :-
```JS
function fun() {
    // This is a function definition.
}

let gun = function () {
    // This is an function expression.
}

(function () {})    // This is an function expression.
```
