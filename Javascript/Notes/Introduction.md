## Javascript :-
- It is a `multipurpose(used for web apps, mobile apps, etc.)` and `multi-paradigm(it supports different styles of programming - functional progamming, object oriented programming, procedural programming, etc.)` programming language(bcz it has decision making capability).
- It is not a purely scripting language like the shell script.
- It's official name is `EcmaScript`.

## Different ways to show/print output in JS :-
1. `console.log("Heloo world!!");`
2. 

## Data types in JS :-
- The ECMAScript language types are :
    - Primitives :
        1. Undefined, 
        2. Null, 
        3. Boolean, 
        4. Symbol, 
        5. BigInt, 
        6. String, 
        7. Number,
    - Non-Primivitive :
        8. Object.

- JS does not differentiate between character and string. ie- it does not has any seperate type as character.

## Operators in JS :-
- `typeof <value>` - it returns the type of any value in string format.
    - eg:- 
    ```JS
        console.log(typeof 12);         // "number"
        console.log(typeof "abcd");     // "string"
    ```
