Note : If we don't close the tags in HTML then the code will still run but it could give 
        absurd results in some cases specially in older browsers so we should remember to close all
        opened tags in respective nested order.
        XHTML has stricter rules and it makes sure that rules that can be ignored in HTML are 
        strictly followed like - Closing all tags (including empty tags like <img/>), 
        using small case for element & attribute names, enclosing attribute values in quotes, etc.

Note : we can put the <title></title> tag in both <head></head> & <body></body>,
        but it is recommended to put it in the <head></head>.

1. Doctype : specifies type of document, like (Html, Xhtml, etc).

2. Links : <a href="url">link text</a>

            The target Attribute :
            -- By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window.
            To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
            The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

            1. _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
            2. _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
            3. _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
            4. _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

            eg : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

            Absolute URL : Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
            Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
            Relative URL : Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not
            include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to
            the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash,
            it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

            Image as a link :
            <a href="default.asp">
                <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
            </a>

            Link to Email Addrs :
            Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program.
            <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

            Link to create Bookmarks :
            HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts
            of a (or same) web page.

            First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
            <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
            Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
            <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
            You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:
            <a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

3. Heading : HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
        Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

4. <p>paragraph</p> : A paragraph always starts on a new line (Block level element), and browsers
automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

5. Horizontal Rules
<hr> : The
<hr> tag defines a thematic break used to separate content
(or define a change) in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as
a horizontal rule.

6. Line break <br> : Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.

7.
<pre> </pre> : The text inside a
<pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
            and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

8. HTML Formatting Elements :
        <b>         - Bold text
        <strong>    - Important text
        <i>         - Italic text
        <em>        - Emphasized text
        <mark>      - Marked text
        <small>     - Smaller text
        <del>       - Deleted text (striked through)
        <ins>       - Inserted text (underlined)
        <sub>       - Subscript text
        <sup>       - Superscript text

9. HTML Quotation and Citation Elements : 
    <blockquote> - defines a section that is quoted from another source, 
                    Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

                    eg : <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
                        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                        For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
                        The world's leading conservation organization,
                        WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
                        1.2 million members in the United States and
                        close to 5 million globally.
                        </blockquote>
    
    <q>          - defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
    
    <abbr>       - defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
                   Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
                   Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 
    
    <address>    - defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
                   <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a 
                       line break before and after the <address> element.

    <cite>       - defines the title of a creative work 
                   (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
                   The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

    <bdo>        - BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
                   The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.

                   eg : <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

                         hue - (0 - 360) where 0 is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
                         saturation - it is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray,
                                      and 100% is the full color.
                         lightness - it is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.

11. Image : <img src="url" alt="alternate-text"> : 
                
                Float property - Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or 
                                 to the left of a text.
                
                eg : 
                <p>
                    <img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
                    The image will float to the right of the text.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    <img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
                    The image will float to the left of the text.
                </p>

            HTML Image Maps :
                With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.
                eg -
                    <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

                        <map name="workmap">
                        <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
                        <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
                        <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
                    </map>
                Shape :
                    rect - defines a rectangular region (x1, y1, x2, y2)
                    circle - defines a circular region (x, y, radius)
                    poly - defines a polygonal region (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...)
                    default - defines the entire region

12. HTML <picture> Element : 
        The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility 
        in specifying image resources.
        
        The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, 
        each referring to different images through the "srcset" attribute. 
        This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view 
        and/or device.
        
        Note: Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element.
              The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, 
                or if none of the <source> tags match.

13. Tables :
        Use the HTML <table> element to define a table.
        Use the HTML <tr> element to define a table row.
        Use the HTML <td> element to define a table data.
        Use the HTML <th> element to define a table heading.
        Use the HTML <caption> element to define a table caption.
        Use the CSS "border" property to define a border.
        Use the CSS "border-collapse" property to collapse cell borders.
        Use the CSS "padding" property to add padding to cells.
        Use the CSS "text-align" property to align cell text.
        Use the CSS "border-spacing" property to set the spacing between cells.
        Use the "colspan" attribute to make a cell span many columns.
        Use the "rowspan" attribute to make a cell span many rows.
        Use the "id" attribute to uniquely define one table.

        <thead>	Groups the header content in a table.
        <tbody>	Groups the body content in a table.
        <tfoot>	Groups the footer content in a table.

14. Lists : 
    1. Ordered - type="1", type="A", type="a", type="I", type="i" .
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ol>
        "start" - to control the counting
            <ol type="I" start="50">
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ol>
    
    2. Unordered - list-style-type: (disc, circle, square, none)
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>
        Note : Use the CSS property "float:left" to display a list horizontally.
    
    3. Description - A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
            <dl>
                <dt>Coffee</dt>
                <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
                <dt>Milk</dt>
                <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
            </dl>

15. Setting The Viewport : <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            
        This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

        The "width=device-width" part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
        (which will vary depending on the device).

        The "initial-scale=1.0" part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded 
        by the browser.
